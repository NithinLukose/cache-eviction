Choosing the Right Strategy: A Decision Tree
To help you choose the right caching strategy, consider the following decision tree:

Is strong consistency required?
Yes: Use Write-Through caching.
No: Proceed to the next question.
Are writes frequent?
Yes: Consider Write-Back caching if eventual consistency is acceptable. Otherwise, use Write-Through.
No: Proceed to the next question.
Is the application read-heavy?
Yes: Use Cache-Aside or Read-Through caching.
No: Re-evaluate your caching needs. Caching might not be the most effective optimization strategy.
